            I am a Computer Science student at the University of Toronto with a strong background in AI, software development, and cloud computing. My experience spans machine learning model development, full-stack application design, and cloud infrastructure optimization. I have worked on projects such as an image denoiser using RBF regression, a React Native app for automated eBay listings, and a penguin species classifier using Azure ML. My focus is on building scalable, efficient, and impactful solutions that bridge the gap between data and innovation. Letâ€™s connect and collaborate on meaningful technology-driven projects.
